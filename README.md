This is a copy of the XIOS2, revision 2252 repository from
https://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/ioserver/svn/XIOS2/trunk/

It is mostly use to collect small bug fixes for NEMO and LFRic,
before they can be merged back into the original repository.

There is no guarantee that the bug fixes and/or patches here
work in general, and I would strongly encourage to use the
original repository.

The `patches` directory contains individual patch files
which can be applied with `patch -p1<patch/XXX`. I hope
this helps using the patches here in other environments
(e.g. spack).
